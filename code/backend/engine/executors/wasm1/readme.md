## Temphia WASM1 ABI

SDK is a expected to be compiled by tinygo and should be taken as canonical spec for any other wasm1 sdk that will live outside this main repo (zig, rust..) as well as other wasm1 compatible executor. Current iteration of wasm ABI is identified by `wasm1`. (vaguely implying there might be wasm2 when different wasm effots like `component`, `wasi` are more stable. ðŸ˜‰).
