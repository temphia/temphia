Temphia is a platform for small apps, also known as "plugs", which run inside a language virtual machine (VM) such as JavaScript (JS) or WebAssembly (Wasm), and communicate with each other through message passing. apps to have specific capabilities based on the resources they are assigned. Each app also has its own private key-value storage for storing simple states, and can optionally assign a data table resource for more complex database needs. Additionally, app has an associated user interface (UI) written in JS, which is executed inside an iframe or sub-origin (e.g., xyzapp.mytemphia.com).
